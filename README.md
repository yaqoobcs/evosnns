Evolution of very Small Spiking Neural Networks for Temporal Pattern Recognition

EvoSNNs is a platform for evolving very small spiking neural networks for a temporal pattern recognition. 
A genetic algorithm is used to optimise connection weights of networks. Individual networks are represented as an adjacancy matrix.
