Evolution of very Small Spiking Neural Networks for Temporal Pattern Recognition

EvoSNNs is a platform for evolving very small spiking neural networks to recognize temporal patterns in a continuous stream of inputs. 
A genetic algorithm is used to optimise connection weights of networks. Individual network is represented by an adjacancy matrix.
